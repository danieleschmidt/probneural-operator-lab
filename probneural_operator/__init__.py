"""
ProbNeural-Operator-Lab: Probabilistic Neural Operators with Active Learning.

Framework for probabilistic neural operators with linearized Laplace approximation 
and active learning capabilities. Implements ICML 2025's "Linearization â†’ Probabilistic NO" 
approach for uncertainty-aware PDE solving with neural operators.

Generation 3 Enhancement: High-Performance Scaling & Production Deployment
- Intelligent caching and performance optimization
- Multi-GPU and distributed training support
- Auto-scaling and dynamic load balancing
- Advanced optimization algorithms (AdamW, Lion, LARS)
- Memory management with gradient checkpointing
- HPC integration (SLURM, MPI) 
- Production-ready model serving with REST API
- Comprehensive performance monitoring
