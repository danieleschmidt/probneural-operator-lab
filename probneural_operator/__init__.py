ProbNeural-Operator-Lab: Probabilistic Neural Operators with Active Learning.

Framework for probabilistic neural operators with linearized Laplace approximation 
and active learning capabilities. Implements ICML 2025's "Linearization â†’ Probabilistic NO" 
approach for uncertainty-aware PDE solving with neural operators.
