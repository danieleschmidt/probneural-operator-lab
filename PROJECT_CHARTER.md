# PROJECT CHARTER: ProbNeural-Operator-Lab

## Project Vision
Create a comprehensive framework for probabilistic neural operators that enables uncertainty-aware scientific computing and optimal data acquisition through active learning.

## Problem Statement
Current neural operator implementations lack principled uncertainty quantification, limiting their applicability in safety-critical scientific computing where understanding model confidence is essential. Existing uncertainty methods are either computationally prohibitive or poorly calibrated.

## Solution Overview
ProbNeural-Operator-Lab provides efficient uncertainty quantification through linearized Laplace approximations, enabling:
- Reliable uncertainty estimates with minimal computational overhead
- Active learning for optimal experiment design
- Calibrated confidence intervals for scientific decision-making
- Physics-informed uncertainty that respects domain constraints
